# Findings

Some stuff to use in the report.

- The initial datasets (raw data) was unreliable because the points were arbitrary. Any attempts to learn patterns wouldn't be able to avg in on a valid solution.
- How do we orient the points? Should we orient them?
- We could have another color, to orient the hips
